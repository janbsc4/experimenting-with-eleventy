		<h1>Growth Hacking</h1>
<h2>1. What is Growth Hacking</h2>
<ul>
<li>“A growth hacker is a person whose true north is growth.”</li>
<li>A growth hacker obsesses about growth.</li>
<li>Product features can now be directly responsible for growth.</li>
<li>“Growth hackers, using their knowledge of product and distribution, find ingenious, technology-based, avenues for growth that sometimes push the bounds of what is expected or advised.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Profile of a Growth Hacker</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t necessarily have to be a programmer.</li>
<li>Marketer which has restricted their activities to growth alone.</li>
<li><em>Analytics</em> is the blood that flows through the veins of a growth hacker. Analytics keep growth hackers honest.</li>
<li>Use experiments and analytics to figure out causation. Causation is a powerful weapon.</li>
<li>You need to know at least something about many different things. But you also need a few things that you’re awesome at to even have a chance at scaling. (T-shape)</li>
<li>If you want to grow a product then get curious. Growth hackers have an urge to think new thoughts and try new things.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. The Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Define Actionable Goals</em>
<ul>
<li>Nested hierarchies until things can be completed once and for all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implement analytics to track Goals</em></li>
<li><em>Leverage existing strengths</em>
<ul>
<li>Rank Chapters 3-6 by score of the companies leverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Experiment</em>
<ul>
<li>Write down your hypotheses before the experiment
<ul>
<li>Be specific. E.g. What will the clickrate be? Why?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be mindful of the resources needed</li>
<li>Don’t get discouraged by initial results, most things fail</li>
<li>Learn from success and failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Optimize the experiment</em>
<ul>
<li>Tweak, rerun experiments</li>
<li>Have a control group!</li>
<li>Use A/B Test! (few tools that create such large gains overall, think like a scientist)</li>
<li>Know when to give up on an experiment (there has to be a good reason)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Repeat (success is a byproduct of tenacity)</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>4. The Funnel</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visitors -&gt; Activation -&gt; Retention</li>

<li>Ratios throughout the funnel are important</li>
</ul>
