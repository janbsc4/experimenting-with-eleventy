# Growth Hacking
## 1. What is Growth Hacking
* “A growth hacker is a person whose true north is growth.”
* A growth hacker obsesses about growth.
* Product features can now be directly responsible for growth.
* “Growth hackers, using their knowledge of product and distribution, find ingenious, technology-based, avenues for growth that sometimes push the bounds of what is expected or advised.”

## 2. Profile of a Growth Hacker
* Doesn’t necessarily have to be a programmer.
* Marketer which has restricted their activities to growth alone.
* *Analytics* is the blood that flows through the veins of a growth hacker. Analytics keep growth hackers honest.
* Use experiments and analytics to figure out causation. Causation is a powerful weapon.
* You need to know at least something about many different things. But you also need a few things that you’re awesome at to even have a chance at scaling. (T-shape)
* If you want to grow a product then get curious. Growth hackers have an urge to think new thoughts and try new things.

## 3. The Process
1. *Define Actionable Goals*
	* Nested hierarchies until things can be completed once and for all
2. *Implement analytics to track Goals*
3. *Leverage existing strengths*
	* Rank Chapters 3-6 by score of the companies leverage
4. *Experiment*
	* Write down your hypotheses before the experiment
		* Be specific. E.g. What will the clickrate be? Why?
	* 	Be mindful of the resources needed
	* Don’t get discouraged by initial results, most things fail
	* Learn from success and failure
5. *Optimize the experiment*
	* Tweak, rerun experiments
	* Have a control group!
	* Use A/B Test! (few tools that create such large gains overall, think like a scientist)
	* Know when to give up on an experiment (there has to be a good reason)
6. *Repeat (success is a byproduct of tenacity)*

## 4. The Funnel
* Visitors -> Activation -> Retention
* Define good conversion rates
	* You should always be improving
	* Some [context](http://blog.totango.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-SaaS-Conversions-Benchmark2.pdf?aliId=9011962), do some research
	* Ratios throughout the funnel are important
* Let the funnel set your priorities
* If your product isn’t loved, focus on the product, not on growth

## Pull Tactics
*Pull:* Incentivise, provide value as a way to get visitors and they will find you. Pull tactics is not directly paying to get visitors
#### Blogging or Guest Blogging
* Why?
	* Good SEO
	* Guest blogging lets you tap into large swaths of your niche market
	* Posts educate, educated people convert better
	* Helps position as a thought leader
* Don’t be too overt about your intentions. Don’t make it feel like an ad
#### Podcasting or guest podcasting
* Inbound pull, niche audiences targetable.
* Less SEO than Blog
#### Ebooks, Guides and Whitepapers
* High perceived value, act as incentive
* Spread well when well executed
* Educates, positions as thought leader
#### Infographics
* Spread really easily
* How to:
	* Find a clever, exciting topic
	* Find the right data (google), analyze it and have integrity
	* Build the narrative. Tell a story with the data.
	* Design + Distribute the infographic (Canva)
#### Webinars
* People take things in their calendar seriously
* Limited seats can make visitors feel important
* Allows interaction and connection
* Can end with special promotion
#### Conference Presentation
* Video/Audio creation
* Persuasion (Steve Jobs)
#### SEO
* Important
* Should be done either as Content or Code
#### Social Media
* Provide value, answer questions.
* Become a thought leader / hub of interesting content.
#### Contests
* Give away experiences
* Consider having second and third place so people feel like they have better odds.
* Better odds the more they do.
* Consider making it run a month.
#### App Store
#### Deal Sites
#### Leverage other peoples audience
* Reach out to group leaders on Meetup.

## Push Tactics
*Push:* More aggressive, find where they are online and push to your product. Ads e.g.
* Keep in mind CLV to estimate budget to move customer through funnel
#### Ads
* In the long run, ads are a business model competition
* Consider AdRoll, Perfect Audience and Retargeter
* Google Ads is technically hardest platform
* Consider persona of customer on the platform (business LinkedIN)
* Circumvent the Ad Network when possible. Contact Blog directly e.g.
* When using cpc, [qualify clicks.](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=9D189BD4-5C68-438F-B7D9-E4EAAE8FDCAD-1023-00000C22A7260D6A&header=Google%20Ads)
	* Put price in copy. Don’t use emotion unless that same emotion will cause them to buy from you.
* Test, test, test.  Copy, images, multiple combinations. 
#### Promo Swap
* For companies that are serving target demographic but aren’t considered competitors.
* Swappable: Social Media Posts, Emails, Sponsored Link, Ad space, Pre-roll video, Giveaway
#### Affiliate
* Think carefully about the incentives
	* Affiliate benefits if you benefit
* Use existing affiliate solutions: Commission Junction e.g.
* Vet Affiliates, they reflect on your Brand
#### Direct Sales

## Product Tactics
*Product:* Everyone that uses the product gets more people to use the product.
#### Network Invitations
* Phone contacts are a big social network. You can use it to “share with friends”
* Email contacts
* Social contacts
#### Social Sharing
* Facilitate It
* Consider Analysis of inbound traffic. Match sharing possibilities with good sources of traffic.
#### API integrations
* Sharing happens frictionless, in the background.
* Risk from intertwining with another product. Don’t count on the rules staying the same
#### Backlinks
* “Get your free email at Hotmail”
#### Incentives
* Dropbox free space, e.g.
* Incentives for using or bringing new people in, educating users
* Works best if its low cost, hight user value
#### Organic word of mouth
* Things that are shared organically: Simple, beautiful, pain relieving, unique
* STEPPS: Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, Public, Stories
* Don’t be all of these things but be at least one

## Activation
Activation is the act of getting visitors to take and action that you’ve decided beforehand, something that furthers your goals.
* Get their email address, create an account, read somethings, comment, share, buy, watch, etc.
#### Landing Pages
* Limited Navigation, Single Call to Action, Congruous Language (should reflect the source they came from)
* Lauch Coming/Soon Page are a good idea. Use emotional imagery. Don’t let the list grow cold
#### Copywriting
* Use [Conversion Copywriting Note](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=9D189BD4-5C68-438F-B7D9-E4EAAE8FDCAD-1023-00000C22A7260D6A)
* Headline should mention the unique value proposition
* Expand and clarify in Subhead
* Long copywriting is good for expensive items, short for cheap
* Research audience to learn words they use
* Use Social Proof/Testimonials
* Don’t forget microcopy (tooltips, hover boxes)
#### Calls to action
* Have an explicit, obvious call to action
#### Onboarding
* Teach people how to navigate your product
* People are not patient, however.
#### Gamification
Progress bars, Awards and Leaderboards can be used to activate visitors
#### Pricing strategy
* Perfect Price Discrimination
	* Create a price structure based on the consumer’s purchasing power
* Multiple Tiers: Just the fact that there is a more expensive option makes you feel like you’re not wasting money. Having a tier below you can make you feel like you’re not a cheap person.
	* Use clear tier names (Team, starter, etc)
* Use free trials and money back guarantee
* Use discount codes and limited time offers
* Bundling is an option to desired reach audiences

## Retention
If retention is low all other hacks are meaningless.
* Increased retention -> Increased CLV -> Increased push budget
#### Staged Traffic
* Get some traffic -> test the rest of the funnel, master retention -> put more resources into traffic
#### Speed to Aha!
Aha Moment: When a user or visitor sees the obvious benefit of your product. Get them there quick
* Do you know what the aha moment is? What actions are key lead indicators of retention?
* Consider sandboxed version for visitors before sign up
* Is there features and clutter that hinders aha?
#### Email
* Drip campaign: Prewritten emails at preselected intervals. Educate, testimonials, case studies, inspo, etc. 
* Event based notifications to suck people back in
* General update about new features, staff, etc. People love to see how other people work
#### Alerts and notifications
#### Exit Interviews
* Ask what sucks most. Use it to improve the product. 
* Be wise for how much you ask. 
* You already lost them so might as well try something to bring them back
#### The Red Carpet
* Do something periodically that makes your primary users feel appreciated.
#### Increase Value
Stay ahead of the value curve to retain users
Subtracting features can increase value
#### Community building
* Use customer support to make people belong to a community
* Provide users with [a way](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=AB1A40EF-876E-4369-9916-FFFFE7A0A1D1-651-000009BACDD9AE65&header=Community%20and%20One-On-One%20Engagement) to connect to each other. Creates retention.
#### Make people happy with your product

## Terminology
#### KPI
* Have a dashboard with important KPI and Trends
* Have automated reports
* Allow everyone to access KPI data
#### Viral Coefficient (K)
People brought to you because of existing users
0-1 good
>1 viral
#### Cohorts
Portion of users based on when they signed up.
KPIs should be improving for new cohorts

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Money it takes to get a new customer
#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)
* Average time customer * Average price payed per time

* Necessary for push tactics

## Tools
#### Google Analytics
Good for high level overviews, lacking for event/people based analytics
#### Event/People Based Analytics
* Attaches scripts to each event on website, instead of the whole page
* Helps answer almost everything: E.g. Do people who watch X have a higher retention rate?
* KISSmetrics and Mixpanel
#### Niche Analytics
There are tools geared for specific niches. E.g. mobile apps, ecommerce.
#### Custom Analytics
Built in-house. Requires engineering resources
